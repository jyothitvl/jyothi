  <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>
  <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design,
    layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
  <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
  <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style</li>
    <li>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolon</li>
    <li>Each declaration includes a CSS propery and value, separated by colon</li>
    <li>Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons, declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
  <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Simple  selectors:</b> select elements based on name, id, class</li>
    <li><b>Combinator selector:</b> select elements based on a specific relationship between them</li>
    <li><b>Pseudo-class selector:</b> select element based on a certain state</li>
    <li><b>Pseudo-elements selectors:</b> select and style a part of an element</li>
    <li><b>Attribute selectors:</b> select elements based on an attribute or attribute value</li>
  </ul>
